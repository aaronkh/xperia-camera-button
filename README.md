for whatever reason sony's camera requires you use the hardware button which shakes the phone when taking pictures

this app adds the button back to the camera app

requires:
* [shizuku to inject events](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku)
* accessibility permissions to capture camera app views
* foreground overlay permissions
